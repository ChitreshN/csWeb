### Overview
MTech in Computing and Mathematics is an interdisciplinary program that is
jointly offered by the CSE and Mathematics disciplines from 2020. The deep
connection between Computing and Mathematics has been long recognised. The
MTech in Computing and Mathematics program is designed to address the
increasing demand for individuals with expertise in both these areas. A
highlight of this program is that both CS and Math students come together. This creates a unique peer-learning environment.

The program offers a mix of
computer science and mathematics /courses that together cover the fundamentals
of computation. The program culminates with a year long project where the
student gets an opportunity to apply the various mathematical tools and
techniques learnt. This will enable them to pursue careers in academia and
industry which involve non-trivial applications of mathematics in computer
science.
