## Latest Curriculum
This page contains the latest B.Tech curriculum applicable for students from the year 2022. To see the details for earlier batches, please see the [2017 curriculum](/btech-curriculum-2017).

The BTech CSE program strives to impart knowledge across the depth and
breadth of Computer Science and Engineering. The curriculum is developed
with a special emphasis on fundamentals and practical learning. The core
courses are intended to prepare and motivate the students for a large
pool of electives which covers several deep and state-of-the-art topics.
The core courses are listed below.

# Suggestive Course plans
To guide the students towards arriving at a feasible ordering of
courses, a course plan is proposed. Multiple variations of this plan are
possible. For instance, a student may take fewer program electives than
what is proposed in the plan if the total credit requirement for program
electives is satisfied. Also, a student may choose to take two project
courses one with 3 credits and the other with 6 credits instead of the
proposed three 3-credit project courses.

The 7th PME course of 1-credit is mentioned in the course plan assuming that
all other PME courses are 3 credits each. In practice, as PME courses may have
varied credits, the number of PME courses is not important and it is only
required that a student obtains at least 19 credits in total.
