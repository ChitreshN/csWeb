### Overview
Master of Science (by Research) and Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering are research-based programs that require students to push the frontiers of human knowledge through a thesis on a topic of their choice. The discipline hosts researchers who work on a wide range of areas such as Theoretical Computer Science, Intelligent and Collaborative Systems, Data Science, and Computer Systems.

Following are the broad areas in which research scholars are currently trained.

**Theoretical Computer Science** -- Combinatorics, Graph Theory, Algorithms, Data Structures, Type Theory, Logic and Complexity Theory. 

**Computer Systems** -- Computer Architecture, CAD for VLSI, Compilers and Programming Languages, Cyber Security, IoT, Distributed systems,  High performance computing. 

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** -- Bayesian learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Kernel Learning, Privacy Aware Learning.
