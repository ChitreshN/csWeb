1	Room no 33, Ahalia Campus	Krithika Ramaswamy	3	3.30 PM	Prof. Saket Saurabh (The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai)	We survey some recent graph algorithms that are based on picking a vertex at random and declaring it to be a part of the solution. This simple idea has been deployed to obtain state-of-the-art parameterized, exact exponential time, and approximation algorithms for a number of problems, such as Feedback Vertex Set and 3-Hitting Set. We will also discuss a recent 2-approximation algorithm for Feedback Vertex Set in Tournaments that is based on picking a vertex at random and declaring it to /not/ be part of the solution.

2	Room no 33, Ahalia Campus	Krithika Ramaswamy	32	4.00 PM	Prof. Venkatesh Raman (The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai)	Suffix Trees discovered in 1973 is a powerful data structure for string processing. They are at the heart of many search engines like Google and of modern genome sequencing packages in Computational Biology. Their practical implementations were possible through a lot of developments in space efficient data structures. We will see a guided tour of suffix trees, their applications and space efficient data structures in this talk.

His primary research interests are in the area of data structures and algorithms, in particular in succinct data structures and parameterized and exact algorithms. He has co-edited four volumes of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, and he is on the editorial board of the Indian Journal of Discrete Mathematics. He has organized or participated in several faculty development programs on algorithms in institutions all over the country.


He has been on the ACM-India council since 2016, where he served as Vice-President from 2018–2020 and Secretary/Treasurer from 2020–2022. He is currently the President of the council. He played key roles in the initiation of ACM-India programs like summer/winter schools, conferences on Computational Thinking in Schools and in the revamped versions of the COMPUTE conference and ARCS symposium for PhD students."
3	Board Room, Ahalia Campus	Krishnamoorthy Dinesh	3	10.00 AM	Dr. Reza Naserasr (IRIF, France)	"In this talk first we explore an extension of the notion of circular coloring form graphs to signed graphs. In particular we present a bipartite analogue of the generalized Mycielski graphs on odd cycles and investigate their circular chromatic number.
To prove the lower bound of 4 we use an elementary notion of the algebraic topology, namely the winding number of a closed curve, thus presenting in an elementary manner a strong connection between the two subjects."

Narayanaswamy (IIT Madras)	"Conflict-free coloring has been a problem of fundamental combinatorial interest over the last two decades. In this talk, I will survey the current results and present some connections to a different optimization problem related to the minimum dominating set.

5	Room No. A01-102, Saraswathi	Srimanta Bhattacharya		3.30 PM	Dr. Arpita Patra (CSA, IISc)	Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) is the standard-bearer and holy-grail problem in Cryptography that permits a collection of data-owners to compute a collaborative result, without any of them gaining any knowledge about the data provided by the other, except what is derivable from the result of the computation. This talk will discuss the fundamental concept of garbled circuits and the Yao's two-party computation which is the first MPC construct in literature. In the end, I will briefly touch upon various applications of MPC.
