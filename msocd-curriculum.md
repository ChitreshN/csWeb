title: MTech in System on Chip Design Curriculum
---
## Curriculum overview
With ever-increasing complexity of workloads, the demand for increased
performance from a computational system cannot be met only through isolated
advances in device technology, circuit design, or system-level design
decisions. Therefore, it is important that future graduates: (i) understand the
performance requirements of complex systems under various operational
constraints, (ii) understand different components and design abstractions that
contribute towards building complex systems, and (ii) apply this understanding
to improve state-of-the-art in System-on-Chip (SoC) design. This curriculum is
designed to meet these objectives and produce graduates with expertise at the
intersection of devices, circuits and systems. At the end of this program, a
student would be able to appreciate and apply advances made across domains to
design better SoCs.


**Core Courses (Theory)**: Advanced Computer Architecture, VLSI design,
Nanoelectronics for Circuits & Systems.

**Core Courses (Lab)**: Advanced Computer Architecture Lab, Programming Lab, System
on Chip Design Lab.

**Electives**: AI for cybersecurity, Cryptography, VLSI Architectures for Signal Processing and Machine Learning, Digital Verification and Testing, Nanoelectronic Devices, Analog Integrated Circuits, RF and Microwave Passive Circuits, Digital Image Processing, RF and Microwave Active Circuits, Principles and Design of Microelectromechanical System, CAD for VLSI, Multirate Signal Processing

## Details
* **Semester I**: Total credits: 15 
* **Semester II**:  Total credits: 15. "Mini Project" is intended to give a student an early start into the major project, knowledge transfer from seniors, and hands-on experience in using tool-chains, experimental set-up. Therefore, based on the interest of a student, this could be a directed reading into a topic, a seminar, or an open-ended project. It is called "Mini project" for lack of a better title. 
* **Semester III**:  Total credits: 15. 
* **Semester IV**:  Total credits: 18.
