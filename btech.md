## About the program
The B.Tech CSE program, started in 2015, strives to impart knowledge across the depth and breadth of Computer Science and Engineering. The core /courses build a strong foundation in our students and most of them have associated labs. This strengthens the theoretical understanding of the students and motivates them to tackle practical problems.
