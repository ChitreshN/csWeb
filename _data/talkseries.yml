The Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Palakkad organized a mini lecture series on Algebraic Algorithms and Matroid Theory from Feb 2 to Feb 6, 2023. The lectures were delivered by Prof. Saket Saurabh.


The lectures introduced the audience to matroid theory and discussed algebraic algorithms for classical problems on matroids. The common theme in these algorithms was observed to be applicability of matrix rank computation. Then the focus shifted to algorithms for graph-theoretic problems using rank computation of certain matrices associated with graphs. This led to the discussion of elegant algebraic algorithms for finding maximum matchings in bipartite graphs and general graphs. The series ended with an interesting interplay among matroid representation, representative families for set systems and parameterized algorithms for NP-complete problems on graphs."

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Palakkad organized a mini lecture series on \"Flow-Augmentation: recent advances in parameterized (weighted) cut problems\" on Monday, August 7, 2023. 

The talks should be self-contained and will only require some basic familiarity with the design of algorithms. 

All are welcome to attend the talks, which are to be held at Room 303, Nila.
The rough schedule is as follows :


* Part 1:  10 am to 11:30 am (Tea and Snacks: 11:30 am to 11:45 am)

* Part 2:  11:45 am to 1 pm 

* Part 3:  2:30 pm to 4 pm


*Summary*:  Network flow and cut problems are well-known classical problems in combinatorial optimization. In this series of talks, we will see how some of the very important questions in the study of parameterized cut problems were resolved using the very recently introduced tool of Flow Augmentation. We start by revisiting the classical (greedy) tools like Important Cuts and Shadow Removal that existed before flow-augmentation and the barriers they imposed in our understanding of the parameterized cut world. We then discuss the powerful tool of Flow-Augmentation which appeared in 2021&2022, followed by stating results that exhibit the power of this new tool. In particular, we focus on how Flow-augmentation yields parameterized dichotomy for (Weighted) Boolean MinCSPs. We then discuss how some fundamental weighted cut problems like Weighted Multicut and Weighted (Subset) Directed Feedback Arc Set, reduce to the tractable class of this Weighted Boolean MinCSP, thereby showing that these problems are fixed-parameter tractable.
