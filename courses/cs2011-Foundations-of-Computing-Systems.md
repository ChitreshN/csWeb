# Course Content

Boolean logic and its implementation - binary digits (bits), transistors
and switching circuits, basic gates and boolean operations using gates,
composability of gates and building blocks of digital circuits such as
multi-bit gates, and multiplexers/demultiplexers. *(3 lectures)*

Combinational circuits - Binary number system, signed numbers (two's
complement), adder and multiplier circuits *(3 lectures)*

Sequential circuits - latches and flip-flops, registers, SRAM and DRAM
cells and their characteristics, memory hierarchy *(3 lectures)*

Instruction Set Architecture - program counter, register set, basic
operations - arithmetic, branch, and I/O operations, instruction
encodings (machine instructions) *(3 lectures)*

CPU design - instruction and data memory, operations within a CPU such
as fetch, decode, execute, and writeback *(6 lectures)*

Assembler - Instruction mnemonics, instruction sequences, symbols,
working of an assembler - symbol table and two-pass assembler *(6
lectures)*

Stack machines - PUSH and POP instructions, procedures and subroutines,
execution stack and argument passing *(6 lectures)*

Compilation - Lexing and parsing, Abstract syntax tree, syntax-directed
translation, illustration of these concepts through an expression to
postfix conversion *(6 lectures)*

Operating systems - Program loading and execution, program isolation
(processes, virtual memory and threads) *(6 lectures)*

# Learning Outcomes
