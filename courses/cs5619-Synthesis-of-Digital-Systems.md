# Course Contents
VLSI Design Flow: Hardware modelling principles and modern Hardware description Languages - Bluespec, High Level Design Representation (3 lectures)

High Level (or Behavioral) Synthesis: Scheduling, Allocation, and Binding Problem; Algorithms for Scheduling, Binding and Allocation (12 lectures)

Register Transfer Level Synthesis: Re-timing and Finite State Machine Encoding techniques (3 lectures)

Logic Synthesis: Two level Boolean Logic Synthesis, and Heuristic based Minimization, Multi-level Implementations (12 lectures)

# Learning Objective
This course aims to give an overview of the VLSI Design flow, introduce the challenges in
synthesizing digital circuits, and the various algorithms and techniques that address these
challenges.

# Learning Outcome
Upon successful completion of the course, students would be able to:
* Recall the steps in a typical VLSI Design flow
* Understand the requirements from a High-level Hardware Description Language (HDL)
* Appreciate the challenges involved in synthesizing digital circuits from behavioral specifications of the circuit
* Apply algorithmic techniques to solve these challenges
