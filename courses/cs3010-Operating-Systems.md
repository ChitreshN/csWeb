# Curriculum 2022
**Prerequisite (if any):** Foundations of Computing Systems, Systems Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Structures and Algorithms Lab, Operating Systems Lab (prerequisite/corequisite)

# Learning outcome:

1. Understand how any operating system functions as a middle layer between the hardware of a computer and the user programs and the various tasks involved in this

2. Appreciate design issues and concepts underlying some of the well known operating systems. 

3. Compare pros and cons of various design options and issues involved in designing an operating system.

# Curriculum 2017
# Learning Objectives 
This course will introduce the student to
the basic concepts involved in the design and implementation of
an operating system. Students will be made familiar to the
important modules of operating systems like process management,
memory management, file systems, synchronization primitives and
exception handling. Important data structures used in the design
of these modules will be introduced. The accompanying lab course
CS3510 is intended to give students an illustration of the
concepts introduced in the theory course.

# Learning Outcomes 
Students will be able to develop an
understanding of how an operating functions as a middle layer
between the hardware of a computer and the user programs and the
various tasks involved in this. By the end of this course,
students will be able to appreciate the design issues and
concepts underlying some of the well known operating systems and
compare the pros and cons of various design options and various
issues involved in the design of a large software.

# Syllabus
1.  Process Management : Scheduling (essential topics:
context-switch, unix fork, scheduling algorithms representing
fairness, infinite wait, optimal scheduling, priority inversion;
2. Synchronization Primitives and Problems: Deadlocks (essential
topics: Peterson\'s algorithm, monitors);
3. Memory Management: Virtual Memory, Demand Paging (essential
topics: fragmentation, pinning, Belady\'s anomaly, thrashing);
4. File systems: I/O Management (essential topics: DMA, delayed
