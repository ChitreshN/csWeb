# Learning Outcomes

1.  Use logical notation to define and reason about fundamental mathematical concepts such as sets, relations, functions, and integers.

2.  Evaluate elementary mathematical arguments and identify fallacious reasoning (not just fallacious conclusions).

3.  Synthesize new proofs based on standard proof patterns.

4.  Apply graph-theoretic models to solve problems like job allocation, scheduling, connectivity etc.

5.  Calculate numbers of possible outcomes of elementary combinatorial processes such as permutations and combinations.

6.  Calculate probabilities and discrete distributions for simple combinatorial processes; calculate expectations.
