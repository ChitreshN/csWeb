# Course Content
1. **Fundamentals**:  Review of Logic and Automated Verification: (1) Propositional and First-Order Logic, (2) Program verification basics -- Hoare logic; Safety properties and invariants, (3) Model checking for Linear Temporal Logic. (9 hours)

2. **Introduction to Runtime Verification (RV).**: Properties and Specifications. Monitorable properties and its characteristics. Overview of different Specification Languages. Overview of Monitor synthesis and instrumentation techniques. (6 hours)

2. **RV of Concurrent Systems**: Types of Concurrency Errors - Atomicity and order violations, deadlocks, starvation, and Livelocks. Monitoring of Concurrent Systems and Error Detection techniques. (6 hours)

3. **Monitoring Events that Carry Data**: Propositional and Parameterized RV, First-Order Temporal Logic, Monitoring Modulo Theories, Parametric Trace Slicing, Rule-based Monitoring, and Stream Processing (12 hours)

4. **Runtime Failure Prevention and Reaction**: Monitor Synthesis. Redundancy based, failure type based, variants based reaction techniques (6 hours)

5. **RV for Decentralized and Distributed Systems**: Applications of RV to Cyber-Physical Systems, Distributed Monitoring (3 hours)

# Learning Outcomes
1. Specify desirable properties of a system using appropriate formal language
2. Implement techniques to synthesize monitors from the specified properties
3. Design solutions to provide correctness guarantees (using RV) to actual systems
