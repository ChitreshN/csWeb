Prerequisites: Familiarity with Probability, Machine Learning

# Learning Objectives:
Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used in sensitive and time-critical systems such
as autonomous driving, cyber physical systems etc. to deliver higher performance and
protect the confidentiality of the systems. Though ML based systems can be used to
classify various malware attacks and develop intrusion detection systems, these systems
are also susceptible to several adversarial attacks. This course covers a systematic
approach on developing ML based cybersecurity methodologies. It will also cover
adversarial attacks which intentionally forces ML systems to behave unexpectedly.

# Learning Outcomes
* Students will be able to develop ML models to classify malwares.
* Able to implement simple intrusion detection systems using deep neural networks.
* They will be able to demonstrate the vulnerabilities in ML systems and state methods to
address adversarial attacks.


# Course contents
1 Overview on Machine Learning with use cases from cybersecurity, classification of threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, malware, trojans etc. (6 lectures)

2 Classification of malware using supervised/unsupervised learning based on signatures and profiling. Decision Tree and context based malicious event detection (9 lectures)

3 Time Series Analysis and Ensemble modelling to detect deviation from normal behaviour, case studies in Reconnaissance detection (9 lectures)

4 Efficient Network Anomaly detection; familiarize with various stages of
network attack and address using deep neural networks, develop intrusion
detection systems (9 lectures)

5 Adversarial attacks on ML systems, model poisoning, black box attacks, white box attacks, state-of-art research paper reading on deep learning systems (9 lectures)
