Prequisites: Familiarity with basic Linear algebra and Probability


## Course Objective:

The course aims to serve as an introduction to the quantum computational
model with the goal of understanding basic quantum algorithms and
analyzing them. The course also addresses limitations of quantum
algorithms and introduces the necessary tools and techniques to prove
the same.

## Course Content:

Brief review of linear algebra and probability preliminaries. (1
lecture)

Basic notions: Qubits, Dirac's notation, operations on qubits, unitary
operators and matrix representations. Single qubit gates - Hadamard,
Rotation, NOT and Phase gates. Multi-qubit gates -- CNOT, Toffoli. SWAP
test. (3 lectures)

Quantum circuits, Church-Turing hypothesis and extensions, Universality
of quantum circuits (1 lecture)

No cloning theorem, Relation to probabilistic computation, Bell pair,
EPR paradox (5 lectures)

Quantum Oracles, Quantum algorithms for promise problems: Deutsch-Jozsa,
Bernstein-Vazirani and Simon (4 lectures)

Phase estimation, Eigenvalue estimation and Quantum Fourier Transforms.
(6 lectures)

Searching in an unstructured database: Grover search -- geometric and
diffusion views. Quantum walks. Optimality of Grover search. (4
lectures)

Shor's algorithm for factoring. Order finding, Period finding,
Reductions. (7 lectures)

Quantum algorithms for hidden subgroup, element distinctness, collision
detection and triangle counting problems. (4 lectures)

Lower bounds. Adversary method, polynomial method, quantum query
complexity (3 lectures)

Quantum Complexity Theory. Complexity class BQP and its connections to
classical computation. (2 lectures)

Advanced topics in quantum computation (if time permits) like Noisy
intermediate scale quantum models, quantum error correction and quantum
proofs for classical theorems (2 lectures)

## Learning Outcomes:

1.  Being able to analyze simple quantum algorithms and argue
    optimality.
2.  Familiarity with 1-qubit / 2-qubit gate operators and ability to
    design simple quantum circuits.
3.  Ability to read and understand recent results as well as research
    papers on quantum algorithms

**Remark:** This course has less than 20% overlap with PH5606 Quantum
Information and Computation offered by the Physics department, IIT
Palakkad. Due to this, students who have already done PH5606 may be
allowed to credit this course.
