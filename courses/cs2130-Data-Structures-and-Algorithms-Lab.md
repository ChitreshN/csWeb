# Curriculum 2022

**Prerequisite (if any) :** Data Structures and Algorithms (prerequisite/corequisite), Systems Programming

# Course Content 

This is a companion lab of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. In
this course, the students will learn to implement basic data structures
in C/C++ and to use them for implementing some of the standard
algorithms they learned in the theory course. A sample offering is given
below.

Weeks 1-2: Iterative and recursive algorithms such as linear search,
binary search, Towers of Hanoi and Euclid's GCD algorithm.

Weeks 3-4: Selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, external merge
sort.

Weeks 5-6: Linked lists - single and doubly linked lists, queue and
stack using linked lists.

Weeks 7-9: Binary trees, binary search trees, expression trees and
infix-postfix conversion.

Weeks 10-11: Heaps and priority queues using min/max heaps. Graphs -
representations and traversals.

# Learning Outcomes 

1.  To be able to implement basic data structures and some of their standard applications.

2.  To develop the ability to design and implement simple algorithms using the appropriate data structure learned in the course.

# Curriculum 2017

This is a companion lab of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. In
this course the students will learn to implement basic data structures
and to use them for implementing some of the standard algorithmic
applications they learned in the theory course.

# Syllabus
