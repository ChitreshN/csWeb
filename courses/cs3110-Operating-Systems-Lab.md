# Curriculum 2022

# Course content
This is a companion lab to the Operating Systems course. In a typical offering,
students extend features in an existing operating system or implement a tiny
operating system which has (primitive) implementation of all the important
features like process management (3 weeks), memory management (3 weeks), file
systems (3 weeks) and  inter-process communication and synchronization (3
weeks).



# Learning outcomes
The student is able to appreciate the various concepts learnt in the theory
course and their implementation in a real operating environment.



# Curriculum 2017

This is a companion lab to the CS3010 Operating Systems course. Students
implement a tiny operating system which has (primitive) implementation
