# Learning Outcomes
* Given a task, derive a learning model by defining appropriate loss function, regulariser, optimization problem and stating the best possible solution.
* Analyse and compare models and algorithms with respect to their complexity, performance and applicability
* Develop models/algorithms with small modifications of existing standard techniques for a modification of known task

# Learning Objectives
* To introduce classical and foundational concepts, results, methodologies and applications in machine learning
* To develop abilities for developing a solution for a given problem starting from problem and data to presenting results
