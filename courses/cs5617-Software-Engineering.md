# Learning Objective
The objective of this course is to give students hands-on experience in designing and
developing a reasonably big software - big enough that it warrants multiple phases (including
architecture, design, and implementation) and multiple developers. During a one semester
period, students will be working in teams, each team building a complete software product.
Through this process, students will be given exposure to various phases of a software
development which includes requirements gathering and specification, systematic design using
commonly seen design patterns, coding, componentwise testing, integration testing, version
control and software cost estimation.

# Learning Outcome
Students will be working in teams and by the end of the semester they will gain experience in
handling various phases of software development. During the project, students assume various
participant roles like developer, project manager, architect etc, in addition to thinking and
deciding on the design of various modules that constitute the software. Students will learn to
follow standard practises throughout the project and to stick to the specification of interfaces
between different software modules so that a big software being developed by multiple persons
can work together as required.

# Teaching Methodology
In this course, students will be required to engineer the
specifications, design, code and test a software component that will work together with other
components that other students develop, therefore, creating a complete software product.
Assessment Methods: Students will work in teams. They are required to design and develop
reasonably big softwares. Requirements for the projects will be intentionally kept brief. Students
are expected to make the detailed specifications first, and then proceed to designing,
implementing, and testing the product. Students assume various participant roles like developer,
project manager, architect etc, like in a real software development process. The marks of a
student will largely be the result of the studentsâ€™ individual component although the small
remaining fraction is decided on how your component integrates with the rest of the
components, and how well they work as a team.
