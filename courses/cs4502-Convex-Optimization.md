# Learning objectives
This course concentrates on recognizing and solving convex optimization
problems that arise in Applications.

# Learning outcome
At the end of the course student will be able to define appropriate
optimization problem for a given practical problem. Student will be able to
implement code and solve an optimization problem using MATLAB and CVX.
