Prerequisite course : Familiarity with basic probability

# Learning Objective
Modeling uncertainty is essential for effective decision making in
many real life applications.  Probability models provide the necessary framework to
model uncertainty. The course aims to provide an exposure to basic concepts of probabilistic
models and how it can be used to solve real problems.

#  Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the course, the student will be able to
* state important definitions, and prove results in probability theory
* write codes for simulation studies
* formulate probabilistic models given real problems
* develop randomized algorithms

# Course Content
Probability spaces, Axioms of Probability, Continuity of probability, Random variables, Common
distributions, Distribution functions, Multiple random variables and Joint distributions, Functions of random
variables, Moments, Conditional probability/expectation, Bayes rule, Sequences of random variables and
convergence concepts, Laws of large numbers, Central limit theorem (3 weeks)

Stochastic process: Poisson process, Hazard functions, Random walk and Markov chain (2 weeks)

Estimators: maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori ​Concentration inequalities:​ Markov,
Chebyshev, Hoeffding, Chernoff inequalities (2 weeks)

Simulation: Inverse transformation method, Techniques for simulating continuous random variables,
MCMC importance sampling, Rejection sampling, Gibbs sampling (3 weeks)

Models: Linear regression, hidden Markov models (2 weeks)

Randomized algorithms: Monte Carlo and Las Vegas methods, randomized quick sort, randomized
algorithm for satisfiability (SAT). (2 weeks)
