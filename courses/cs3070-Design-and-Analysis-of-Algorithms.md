# Course Content

*Review of Basic Concepts*

Asymptotic analysis of efficiency of algorithms, amortized analysis with
an example (binary counter or stack with multipop), lower bounds for
searching, finding maximum and sorting *\[6 lectures + 1 tutorial
hour\]*

*Graph Search Algorithms:* DFS and BFS with applications to connectivity
in undirected graphs, topological sorting and strongly connected
components in directed graphs, shortest paths in unweighted graphs. *\[6
lectures + 3 tutorial hours\]*

*Algorithm Design Paradigms*

Overview of design paradigms - greedy strategy, dynamic programming,
divide and conquer, iterative improvement.

Greedy Algorithms - optimal substructure and greedy choice, shortest
paths in directed acyclic graphs, Dijkstra\'s algorithm, minimum
spanning trees, cut property and cycle property theorems, Prim\'s
algorithm, Kruskal\'s algorithm - union-find data structure and
amortized analysis of path compression heuristic. *\[10 lectures + 3
tutorial hours\]*

Dynamic Programming - optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems,
ordering of subproblems and memoization, revisiting shortest paths in
directed acyclic graphs, Bellman-Ford algorithm, all-pairs shortest
algorithms and Floyd-Warshall algorithm. *\[8 lectures + 3 tutorial
hours\]*

Iterative Improvement - Networks and flows, Max-flow min-cut theorem,
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, Edmonds-Karp algorithm. Matching in bipartite
graphs using flows. *\[7 lectures + 1 tutorial hour\]*

*Computational Complexity*

Polynomial time reductions, classes NP, co-NP and P, NP-complete
problems. *\[7 lectures + 1 tutorial hour\]*

*Remarks:* The tutorials sessions will typically be utilized for
discussing problem sets and/or evaluating programming assignments.
Course contents overlap with MCaM core course CS5009 Algorithms,
however, CS5009 is not an elective for UG.
