**Prerequisite (if any):** Foundations of Computing Systems (prerequisite/corequisite)

This is a companion lab to Foundations of Computing Systems that enables
the students to build a computer from first principles. A typical
offering of this course will illustrate examples of

\(i) combinational circuits such as adders and multipliers (1 week)

\(ii) sequential circuits for real world tasks such as vending machines
(1 week)

\(iii) a simple register-based CPU (3 weeks)

\(iv) assemblers for the CPU introduced (3 weeks)

\(v) abstract stack-based machines (2 weeks)

\(vi) simple compilers and translators (2 weeks)

**Learning Outcomes:**

Understand the implementation of the different components of a computer
system (digital hardware, microarchitecture, operating systems and
compilers) and their interconnection.
