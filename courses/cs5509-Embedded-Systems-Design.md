# Learning Objectives
Design of an embedded system involves one crucial aspect: the tradeoffbetween implementing some
functionality in hardware versus software. Typically, hardware functions tend to be more efficient, predictable
and deterministic when compared tosoftware, but design and development of hardware functions is also
expensive and timeconsuming. In this course, the students will understand this trade-off through a series of
casestudies and projects. Students will also learn various tools and formalisms necessary to make decisions
pertaining to this trade-off.

# Learning Outcomes
* State and apply the principles of embedded system design.
* Design an embedded system considering the trade-off between designingfunctionality in
hardware versus software.
* Perform design analysis and modular implementation for a complete system.
