# Learning Objectives
The objective of the course is to equip the student to recognize and solve modern machine
learning problems those arise in practical applications.

# Learning Outcome
At the end of this course students will be able to implement and use some of
the state-of-the-art techniques of machine learning. They will be able to
compare pros and cons of various methods in terms of using them to solve some
real world problems. Students will be able to analyse the complexity of an
optimization problem and its solution.
