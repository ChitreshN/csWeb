# Course Objectives

The objective of this course is to teach student
everything about pre-silicon functional verification of VLSI RTL
designs. Emphasis of the course is on frontend design & verification
methodologies and on their practical applications. The course contents
have been designed keeping in view the emerging trends in needs for
skilled manpower in ASIC/SOC industry.

# Learning Outcomes
1.  Thorough working knowledge in writing test benchesÂ 
2.  Proficiency in industry standards and methodologies for functional
    verification of ASIC/SOC designs
