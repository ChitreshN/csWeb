# Course Content
The main theme of this course is certified programs, ie. Programs that come
with a proof that it meets the desired specifications. A specification is a
property that the program has to satisfy for it to be acceptable and we say
that the program is correct if it executes according 10 its specification. For
example, a railway signaling software should not set the signals such that it
allows two trans to be on. Single line at the same time. 

One important property of purported proof of correctness is that they are *formal* in the sense that they are checked *by the computer* for correctness. The proof of correctness of the program thus acts as a *computer verifiable certificate* for program correctness.

To write such certified programs, we need

1. A language to write the program in
2. A language to write the specifications
3. A mechanism to verify that the given program meets the necessary specification,

In this course, we study how to use the proof assistant Coq to build such
certified programs. The Coq proof assistant gives a unified way to expression
programs and specifications. Programs written for Coq need to be of the correct
"type" and the cog interpreter checks for this. This type checking works as the
formal mechanism for checking the correctness of proofs.

The underlying mechanism behind the Coq proof assistant can also double up in
formulating and proving statements in mathematics â€” for a recent success see
the complete proof of Fiet-Thompson theorem in Coq. Although we emphasize
certified programs, what we learn in this course is applicable to proving
mathematical statements in general and should be of interest to mathematicians
and logicians as well,
