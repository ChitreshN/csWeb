# Course contents
This is a companion lab to Computer Architecture
course. A typical offering will either require students to
implement/extend microarchitectural features in a cycle accurate
simulator, or implement a simple processor from scratch using a HDL. The
assignments may include design of micro-architecture blocks (2 weeks),
experiments on instruction set architecture and its data-path (3 weeks),
exploration of data hazards in pipelining (2 weeks) and memory hierarchy
(3 weeks).

# Learning Outcomes
Students are able to appreciate the concepts
learnt in the theory course and the challenges in applying them in
practice.
