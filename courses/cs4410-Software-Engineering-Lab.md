# Learning Objectives
The objective of the course is to study modern software engineering standards,
methods, and common practices to deliver error-free codes that meet the
requirements precisely.

# Learning Outcome
After completion of the course students will be able to write requirement
specifications, prepare design documents, analyse existing designs, prepare
test cases, and analyse codes.

# Course Content
System Requirement Specification (SRS) and related analysis documents as per
the guidelines in ANSI/IEEE Std 830-1984. Design documents representing the
complete design of the software system. The design can further be improved by
the principles learned in this module.  Analysis and design for the same
problem should be done using Object-Oriented (O-O) approach. Test documents as
per ANSI/IEEE Std. 829/1983 Software Test Documentation.  Simple exercises in
effort and cost estimation in the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO).
Application of COCOMO and Function Point (FP) model for the actual project that
has been chosen. Familiarization of Software Configuration Management (SCM)
tools with some public domain software like Source Code Control System (SCCS),
Concurrent Versions System(CVS).  Familiarization of some reverse engineering
tools available in the public domain.
