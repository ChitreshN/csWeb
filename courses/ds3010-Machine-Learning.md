# Learning Outcomes
* State definitions, theorems/results, algorithms related to key concepts
* Apply standard techniques to solve known problems
* Given a task, derive a learning model by defining appropriate loss function, regulariser, optimization problem and stating the best possible solution.
* Analyse and compare models and algorithms with respect to their complexity, performance and applicability
* Develop models/algorithms with small modifications of existing standard techniques for a modification of known task
