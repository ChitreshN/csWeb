**Prerequisite (if any) :** Systems Programming or Introduction to Programming

# Course Content 

*Introduction*

Computation, algorithms and data structures. Elementary data types,
abstract data types and data structures. RAM model of computation.
Example of computational problems and algorithms - searching an element
in an array using linear search and binary search. Notion of efficiency
of algorithms - running time and memory consumption. Notions of best,
worst and average case complexity. *\[3 lectures\]*

*Iteration and Recursion*

Iterative and recursive algorithms (Towers of Hanoi, Euclid's GCD
algorithm), proof of correctness using induction. Sorting arrays using
selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort and merge sort (with proof of
correctness and efficiency analysis). *\[8 lectures\]*

*Asymptotic Analysis*

Asymptotic notation. Estimates of binomials and factorials. Methods of
solving recurrences using induction, recursion tree and Master method.
Application of asymptotics to analysing efficiency of algorithms. *\[8
lectures\]*

*Linear Data Structures*

Arrays and linked lists (single and doubly linked lists). Array and
linked list based implementations for Queue and Stack. Applications to
infix-postfix conversion and expression evaluation. *\[6 lectures\]*

*Non-linear Data Structures*

Trees - rooted trees, traversal of trees, binary trees, expression
trees, binary search trees. Heaps and priority queues using min/max
heaps. *\[8 lectures\]*

Graphs - adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations, depth
first search, breadth first search. *\[6 lectures\]*

Hash tables - hash functions, open addressing, chaining. *\[3
lectures\]*
