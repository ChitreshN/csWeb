# Introduction

Underneath many applications in real life like robotics, crytography,
error correcting codes etc are certain basic computational tasks like
gcd computation, factoring etc. This course is a study on such
computational problems and the algorithms for them. We build on the
necessary background from algebra and use it to give rigorous analysis
of the performance of these algorithms.

# Contents

The following topics will be covered in this course

1.  Basic algorithms for arithmetic, addition, multiplication and
    modular arithmetic. (4 lectures)

2.  Euclid\'s algorithm, Chinese Remainder theorem and applications to
    problems like determinant computation, Gaussian elimination. (6
    lectures)

3.  Fields, Finite fields, Field of rationals, Polynomial factorisation
    over finite fields (6 lectures)

4.  Hensel lifting and application to bivariate factoring (4 lectures)

5.  Shortest vector problem and LLL algorithm. Application to
    factorisation of polynomial over rationals. (5 lectures)

6.  Applications of polynomial factorisation. (5 lectures)

7.  Multivariate system of polynomial equation and Grobner basis (7
    lectures)

8.  Algorithms from number theory and cryptography (5 lectures).

# Pre-requisites

None. The course will start from the very basics.

# Learning Outcomes

1.  To state and analysis algorithms for tasks like arithmetic,
    factorisation.

2.  To apply the algorithms learned to tasks in cryptography, number
    theory etc.
