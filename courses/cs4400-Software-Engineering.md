# Learning Objectives
The objective of the course is to study modern software engineering standards, methods, and
common practices to deliver error-free codes that meet the requirements precisely.

# Learning Outcome
After completion of the course students will be able to write requirement
specifications, prepare design documents, analyse existing designs, prepare
test cases, and analyse and estimate softwares.

# Course Content
The process of software development - Process models. Software measurement – Software
process improvement by metrics- Size-oriented metrics and function point metrics. Engineering
of software systems - Analysis concepts and principles - Analysis modeling - Data modeling -
Specification techniques for software. Design concepts and principles - Abstraction -
Refinement - Modularity - Architectural design - Cohesion coupling concepts - Refactoring of
designs. Object-Oriented (O-O) Approach to software design - Concepts - Design issues -
Modeling techniques Design process - Design patterns. Software Testing - Principles -
Designing test cases - Testing strategies - Debugging - Introduction to O-O testing. Software
project planning - Effort and cost estimation techniques - Lines of Code (LOC)-based and
Function-point based measures - The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) model. Software
Quality Assurance(SQA) - Software Reliability - The ISO 9000 Quality standards – Capability
Maturity Model (CMM). Software Configuration Management (SCM) - process and standards.
