Requires CS5616 Computational Complexity as a prerequisite


# Course Objective
This is a topics/advanced course in computational complexity theory to serve as
a follow up on the first course CS5616 Computational Complexity. The objective
is to expose the student to a set of seemingly unrelated topics from circuit
complexity, randomness and computing, lower bounds and derandomization and
bring out how they are related.

# Course Content
Brief review of basic complexity classes and definitions. (1 lecture)

Counting complexity -- Counting classes: #P, FP, GapP, Parsimonious reductions, #P-completeness, Examples of counting problems, Permanent is #P-complete - Valiant's theorem, Quantifiers versus counting: Valiant-Vazirani Lemma, Unique SAT, randomized reductions, Toda's theorem (8 lectures)

Circuit Complexity -- Sequential versus parallel computation. Boolean circuits, basis and complete basis. Shannon's lower bound, Lupanov's upper bound, Circuit complexity classes -- NC, SAC, AC and their relation to other complexity classes. Constant depth reductions. (6 lectures)

Space bounded computation -- Branching programs, Bounded width branching programs and Barrington's theorem. (4 lectures)

Circuit lower bounds -- Gate elimination technique, Formula lower bounds - Subbotovskaya and Neciporuk's lower bound, Random restrictions, Parity cannot be computed by AC0 circuits, Razborov-Smolensky polynomial approximation method and ACC lower bounds. Razborov's proof of clique lower bounds for monotone circuits. (12 lectures)

Interactive Proofs -- Motivation and definition, AM, MA proof systems. Sum check protocol. Random self reducibility and interactive proof for Permanent (7 lectures)

Hardness versus Randomness - Pseudorandom generators, Nisan Wigderson generator, Derandomizing BPP under worst case assumption. Impagliazzo-Kabanets theorem. (4 lectures)

# Learning Outcomes
1. Being able to understand and appreciate the fundamental notions of reductions, ideas of hardness, completeness, randomness and proofs.

2. Get a deeper understanding of the power and limitations of related computational models like branching programs and Boolean circuits and their relation to Turing machines.
