# Course Objective
Real time systems requires the software to meet timing constraints. This is achieved selecting
suitable scheduling algorithms. The problem becomes challenging when tasks share resources.
Priority inversions can take place in this case, unless suitable techniques are deployed. The course
starts with introducing different types of real time systems/ Important real-time process scheduling
algorithms discussed next followed by resource sharing protocols. Portable Operating System
Interface (POSIX) standardization for real time systems named POSIX-RT is also reviewed towards
the end. The course will brief on open source real time system and programming assignments will be
given.

# Learning Outcomes
Ability to design and develop a real time systems from the given specifiactions and
requirement.
Ability to create task scheduling for set of periodic tasks using proper scheduling
algorithm(s).
Ability develop real-time systems with sporadic tasks with proper scheduling methods.
Skill to integrate resource access mechanisms.
Make students capable of developing real time systems using the fundamental theory and
programming assignment(s) given covered in the course.
