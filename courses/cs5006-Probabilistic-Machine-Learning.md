# Learning Objectives
To know the role of probability theory in solving problems in the real world
related to data. The problems can range from predicting future consequences to analysing historical data.
The domain of problems can be healthcare, education, governance to mention a few.

# Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course, the students should be able to precisely define, and solve
classical and commonly encountered problems along with deriving connections across multiple similar
solutions and models.

# Course content
1. Introduction: Probabilistic data analysis. [3]

2. Bayesian models: classifications, clustering, regression. Sequential Bayesian learning for Big-Data. [18]

3. Hierarchical Bayesian models: generative modeling. Topic models. Markov models. Inference, and estimation techniques for probabilistic models: MCMC, Gibbs sampling, variational inference. [18]

4. Case study using Natural Language Processing/Computer Vision/Bioinformatics. [3]
