# Course Objectives
The objective of the course is to know about the responsibility of artificial intelligence (AI) to make AI
more useful for society and humanity. The course will also teach principles and practices to perform
responsible AI.

# Learning Outcomes
* To be able to state aspects of responsible AI such as fairness, accountability, bias, privacy etc.
* To be able to assess the fairness and ethics of AI modules.
* To be able to enforce fairness in models and remove bias in data.
* To be able to preserve the privacy of individuals while learning from them.
* To be able to develop responsible AI modules for given practical problems and estimate the tradeoff with accuracy.
