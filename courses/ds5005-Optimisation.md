Introduction: Motivation and examples (3 hours)

Basics: Rd, vectors, matrices, norm, sequences & convergence, functions in one and several variables, Taylor series, derivatives, gradient, sub-gradient, Hessian, properties of symmetric operators, contours, affine functions, hyperplanes, convex functions, minima: local and global, subspaces, affine spaces,
half-spaces, convex sets (9 hours)

Unconstrained Optimisation: gradient descent, line search, rates for various
classes of convex functions, steepest descent, Newton’s method, conjugate
gradient method, quasi-Newton method, linear least-squares regression: rates (9 hours)

Constrained Optimisation: linear and convex constraint sets, linear
programming, simplex, interior-point method, duality theory: primal/dual
programs, weak, strong duality, KKT conditions (12 hours)

Keifer-Wolwowitz method, simultaneous perturbation stochastic
approximation (SPSA) method, smoothed functional method (9 hours)

# Learning Outcomes
As a result of this course, the student should be able to
* Pose a given optimisation problem by identifying the objective and constraints.
* Draw level sets and graphs of functions, identify constraint regions described by set of function.
* Choose stepsize and identify rates of convergence of optimisation algorithms.
* Use stochastic optimisation techniques to derive data driven algorithms .

# Learning Objectives
To
* Look at the regions and functions in `d’ dimensions.
* Build algorithms that find minima using first and second order information.
* Look at constraint optimisation and duality theory with linear programming as a special case.
* Introduce basics of stochastic optimisation
