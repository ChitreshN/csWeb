# Curriculum 2017

Week 1: Specification of language tokens using one of the tools for
lexical analysis: lex, flex, ml-lex.

Week 2 : Language to evaluate arithmetic expressions.

Week 3-4 : Specification of language using one of the LALR
parsing tools: yacc, bison, ml-yacc.

Week 5-6 : Develop a parser for a language that consists of elementary data types, and arithmetic, relational, and logical operator (s), control statement(s) and loop construct(s), and functions.

Week 7-8: Creation of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the
language grammar

Week 9-10: Conversion of AST to an intermediate code.

Week 11-12: Code generation from the intermediate code for a
specific compute architecture: MIPS.

# Learning Outcomes
Develop a compiler covering all phases from
lexical analysis to code generation and gain the skill of developing a
system software from scratch.
