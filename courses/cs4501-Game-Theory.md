# Learning Objectives
The main objective of this course is to introduce the fundamental tools of game theory, a few
equilibrium concepts, apart from numerous exercises.

# Learning Outcome
Upon successful completion of this course, students are expected to:
* Differentiate between different types of games
* Identify various equilibria within games
* Gain knowledge about fundamental concepts of non-cooperative and cooperative game theory
* Explain precisely, and apply solution concepts to examples of games
* Retain and apply the mathematical concepts discussed over the duration of the course.

# Course Content
Introduction: motivation, theory of rational choice, utility functions [3 lectures]

Strategic form games: definition, examples, dominant strategy equilibria, pure strategy Nash
equilibrium, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, existence of Nash equilibrium, potential games,
games with infinite strategy space, zero sum games, minimax theorem, Braess paradox, price of
anarchy. [7 lectures]

Extensive form games: definition, examples, games of imperfect information,
games of incomplete information, repeated games, the folk theorem of average
payoffs. [6 lectures]

Designing games and mechanisms: Fair division, stable matching and allocation,
auctions, truthful auctions in win/lose settings, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves
mechanism, scoring rules, matching markets [10 lectures]

Cooperative games: Transferable utility games, the core, the Shapley value,
Nash bargaining [8 lectures]

Social choice and voting: Voting and ranking mechanism, Arrowâ€Ÿs Impossibility Theorem, The
Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem, desirable properties of voting and ranking [8 lectures]
