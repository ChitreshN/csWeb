# Learning Outcomes
* Preparing for data summarization, query, and analysis.
* Applying data modelling techniques to large data sets
* Creating applications for Big Data analytics
* Building a complete business data analytic solution

# Learning Objectives
The primary objective of this course is to optimize business decisions and create a
competitive advantage with Big Data analytics. This course will introduce the basics
required to develop map reduce programs, derive business benefit from unstructured data.
This course will also give an overview of the architectural concepts of Hadoop and
introducing map reduce paradigm. Another objective of this course is to introduce
programming tools PIG & HIVE in Hadoop ecosystem.
