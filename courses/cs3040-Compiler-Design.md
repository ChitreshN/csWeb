# Curriculum 2022

# Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course we expect the student to
know enough of the theory (Parsing, Code generation, optimisation) and
tools (parser generators, code generators) so that they can build a
compiler that converts from a non-trivial high level language to a machine
code.

# Syllabus

Introduction to language translators and overview of the compilation
process. *(5 lectures)*

Lexical analysis: specification of tokens, token recognition, conflict
resolution. *(5 lectures)*

Parsing: Overview of Context Free Grammars (CFG), Parse trees and
derivations, left recursion, left factoring, top-down parsing, shift
reduce parsing, conflict resolution. *(10 lectures)*

Syntax directed translation. Semantic analysis, Type checking,
intermediate code generation. *(6 lectures)*

Runtime environments: activation records, and heap management. *(6
lectures)*

Code optimization: basic blocks, liveness, register allocation. *(5
lectures)*

Advanced topics: Overview of machine dependent and independent
optimizations. *(4 lectures)*

# Curriculum 2017

# Learning Objectives
A compiler is a program that converts high level
(human understandable) language to low level (machine understandable)
code. Compilers are what makes writing modern software possible and
their study has been one of the classical topics in an Undergraduate
Computer Science curriculum. The objective of the course is to introduce
the basic theory underlying the different components and phases of a
compiler like parsing, code generation etc. Simultaneously, the students
will be familiarised with the various tools that are used for building
modern compilers.

# Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course we expect the student to
know enough of the theory (Parsing, Code generation, optimisation) and
tools (parser generators, code generators) so that they can build a
compiler that converts from a non-trivial high level language to machine
code.
