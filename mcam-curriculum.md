title: MTech in Computing and Mathematics Curriculum
---


## Curriculum overview
First semester curriculum is designed with the above diversity in mind. Apart from the common
/courses, M.Sc. Mathematics students will be trained in certain basic core /courses from computer
science and B.Tech. Computer Science and Engineering students will be trained in some core
mathematics /courses.  Later semesters will comprise of a wide spectrum of advanced /courses in
both   the   domains.   Major   areas   include   Algorithms,   Graph   Theory,   Combinatorics,   Logic,
Computational Methods and Foundations of Data Science & Machine learning. The program
culminates with an year long Project/Dissertation in the second year, that prepares students to
pursue careers that require innovations involving sophisticated applications of mathematics in
computer science.



**Core /courses (Theory)**: Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Topics
in Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms, Theory of Computation, Graph Theory and
Combinatorics, Foundations of Data Science and Machine Learning.


**Core /courses (Lab)**: Programming Lab, Computational Methods and Applications.
## Details

* **Semester I**: Total credits is 18. If a student has already credited a course with a similar content as some core course
prescribed in this curriculum, during his/her previous degree, then a program elective course may
be credited instead of that course, for completing the credit requirements. For this, the permission
of the faculty advisor is to be obtained.
* **Semester II**: Total credits is 16.
* **Semester III**: Total credits is 14. The students are free to take Open Electives either from the set of Program Electives or from the set of any research or PG level electives in the institute. 
* **Semester IV**:  Total credits is 12. Minimum credit requirements is 58 credits
