title: Labs, Centres and Facilities
---
Following are Labs, Centres and Facilities in and around CSE department. The computational labs, research labs and research-cum-teaching labs are common institute facilities.


# Centres
Our faculty members are involved in the following centers.
## [Centre for Research and Education in Data Science (CREDS)](https://creds.iitpkd.ac.in/)
CREDS has been established jointly by faculty members from CSE, DS,  EE, CE, ME, MA, PHY, and HSE with the vision to provide world class education, pursue cutting edge research, and develop data science and artificial intelligence for the benefit of society. 

## [Centre for Computational Imaging (CCI)](https://cci-iitpkd.github.io/)
This central interdisciplinary center is engaged in pushing the frontiers in all aspects of imaging - sensing and image acquisition, processing and visualization, and acceleration. The center aims to synergize research across several layers of the computational system to identify new opportunities for improvements.

# Labs
Our faculty members are involved in the following  labs.
## Advanced Architecture Lab (AAL)
This lab is set up to pursue research on various aspects of Computer architecture and design including research and development of novel system architectures, micro-architectural features, and design methodologies that are secure and energy-efficient in addition to achieving high-performance

## Lab for Advanced VLSI and Artificial Intelligence (LAVA)
This lab is established jointly with faculty from EE to achieve excellence in IC design and research using the latest technology at the global level with state-of-the-art synthesis and simulation facilities. The goal in the future is to work towards setting up an IC design hub  that develops in-house IP cores for IoT applications and to facilitate research in Artificial Intelligence for the entire spectrum of high performance computing to embedded platforms.

# Facilities
The campus is fully Wi-Fi enabled with mobility in Internet Access. 
## [High Performance Computing](https://hpc.iitpkd.ac.in/)
The Chandra High performance computing cluster (HPC) provides a powerful computing platform for research in engineering and physical sciences. This system has been operational since June 2017. The HPC consists of 64 compute nodes, each with a dual 12-core Intel processor. Each core runs at 2.2 GHz and has 4 GB of RAM per core. The HPC is one of the first systems in India to use a 100 Gbps high-speed OmniPath interconnect from Intel. The system provides about 54 TFlops of computing power. Chandra also accesses 100 TB of disk space setup as a parallel file system running Lustre from Intel. 



## Computing Centre
IIT Palakkad has a state-of-the art Computing Centre with 255 All-In-One Dual Boot Desktops, spread across four different labs, connected centrally to the File Server with LDAP authentication. All machines are Internet enabled via high-speed network. There are four high-end Servers for the computing. A firewall and Squid Proxy Server are used for access control. The labs are equipped with projectors. For more details check out the [Centre for Education Technology](https://cet.iitpkd.ac.in/)  at IIT Palakkad.
